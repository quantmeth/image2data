Description: The goal of 'image2data' is to extract images and return
    them into a data set, 
    especially for teaching data manipulation and data visualization. 
    Basically, the eponymous function takes an 
    image file ('png', 'tiff', 'jpeg', 'bmp') and turn it into a data set,
    pixels being rows (subjects) and columns (variables) being their coordinate positions (x- and y-axis) and their respective color (in hex codes). 
    The function can return a complete image or a range of color (i.e., contour, silhouette).
    The data can then be manipulated as would any data set by either creating other related variables (to hide the image) or as a genuine toy data set.
